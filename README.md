# Fork, Clone, Add Code, and Commit to a Repository

This guide provides a step-by-step overview of how to fork a repository, clone it to your local machine, add code by creating a separate folder, and commit the changes back to the repository.

## Forking a Repository

1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.

2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository's page.

3. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Cloning the Forked Repository

4. Open your terminal or command prompt.

5. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.

6. Use the `git clone` command to clone your forked repository.

## Adding Code

7. Create a new folder within the cloned repository to organize your code.

8. Add your code or files to the newly created folder.

9. Use the `git add` command to stage the changes.

10. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.

## Pushing Changes to the Repository

11. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

## Creating a Pull Request

12. Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.

13. Click the "New Pull Request" button.

14. Compare the changes and, if everything looks good, click "Create Pull Request."

15. Add a title and description for your pull request.

16. Click "Create Pull Request" again to submit it.

That's it! You've successfully forked, cloned, added code, and created a pull request for the repository.

Happy coding!
